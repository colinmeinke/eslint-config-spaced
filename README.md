# Spaced

This is a shareable ESLint config to lint ~~your~~ my Javascript.
It supports ES2015+ and React.

## Installation

As well as installing this config, ~~you~~ I will also need to install `eslint-config-airbnb` which it extends,
`eslint-plugin-react` which that  library depends on,
and `eslint` itself.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-spaced eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-react eslint
```

## Usage

Simply in ~~your~~ my `.eslintrc`:

```
{
  "extends": "spaced"
}
```
